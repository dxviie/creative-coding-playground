# creative-coding-playground
Creative coding playground: easily create and record sketches based on p5js, paperjs, ...

Run locally:
```bash
cd ccp-svelte
npm run dev
```

### Note: use on your own risk, this is a playground for creative coding, not a production-ready tool. Not even close to it.

But I don't bite either, so feel free to ask questions or suggest improvements.

Have fun!
